# TaskManager
A MERN stack task manager for seamless organization and productivity tracking, perfect for individuals and small teams.

# Overview
The Cloud-Based Task Manager is a web application designed to streamline team task management. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform provides a user-friendly interface for efficient task assignment, tracking, and collaboration. The application caters to administrators and regular users, offering comprehensive features to enhance productivity and organization.



### Why/Problem?
In a dynamic work environment, effective task management is crucial for team success. Traditional methods of task tracking through spreadsheets or manual systems can be cumbersome and prone to errors. The Cloud-Based Task Manager aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform for task management, enabling seamless collaboration and improved workflow efficiency.


### How this works
This system is set up for the admin to have full control. They can assign tasks, update, delete, and create user profiles. Only the admin can verify tasks and mark them as completed. This ensures streamlined management and oversight.Users can complete their tasks and comment on the particular task to let the admin know about it.
